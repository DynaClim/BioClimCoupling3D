# Visualisation Notebooks

All the notebooks here allow you to plot data generated by the 3D coupling:

- **Plot_diagfi_global.ipynb**: Plots the main variables from `diagfi_global.nc`, which is generated at each iteration of the coupling.  
  ðŸ‘‰ You just **need to update the file path** to point to your `diagfi_global.nc`.

Other notebooks will be added soon...
