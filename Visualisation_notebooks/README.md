# Visualisation Notebooks

All the notebooks here allow you to plot data generated by the 3D coupling:

- **Plot_diagfi_global.ipynb**: Plots the main variables from `diagfi_global.nc`, which is generated at each iteration of the coupling.  
  ðŸ‘‰ You just **need to update the file path** to point to your `diagfi_global.nc`.

- **Creating_corrk_tables.ipynb**: Creates low resolution corrk tables and corrk repository required by GCM. Plots spectra.  
  ðŸ‘‰ You just **need to update these file paths** :
  ```python
  # Paths
  datapath_ktables = 'Ktables/'
  datapath = './'
  datapath_LR = 'LowRes/'
  ```
  

  
*Other notebooks will be added soon...*
