# Low Resolution K-Tables

This folder contains all the low-resolution correlated-k (corrk) tables required for 3D coupling, in both the infrared (IR) and visible (VI) spectral ranges.

These tables are generated by the Jupyter notebook `Creating_corrk_tables.ipynb` located in the [Visualisation_notebooks](../Visualisation_notebooks) folder.
